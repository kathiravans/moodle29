SOAP Full Documented Array Plugin
=================================

Features
-----------------------

This plugin extends the original soap plugin. 
It resolves the issue MDL-28988: generate a WSDL with full documented array

I hope that in the future this plugin will be integrated in the official moodle relese :)

Installation
------------

1. Add the plugin into /webservice folder.
2. Enable the SOAPFDA protocol under site administration -> plugins -> web services -> manage protocols.
